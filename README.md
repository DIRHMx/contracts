## Motivation

One of the peculiarities of recruitment is opacity when it should be a business based on transparency and openness because **all of this it's not about apples or windows but people**.

We are committed to change that model with a candidate-centric approach and, as a first step toward our goal, **we have *opensourced* the contracts we use with both candidates and companies** so they can be read, studied, compared, discussed and used by the Community.

It's just a little contribution but hopefully it could help to disrupt the hiring status quo.

## Getting Started

**It is important to distinguish between language and jurisdiction**. Law changes depending on where the contract object is located but it could be redacted in local language or not because at the end it's a private agreement.

Because that, files in our contracts repository are following this nomenclature:

* candidates: 'candidates_' + COUNTRY + [ISO 369-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), for language (e.g. candidates_SPAIN_ES.md)
* companies: 'companies' + COUNTRY + [ISO 369-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1), for language (e.g. companies_SPAIN_ES.md)

Contracts are provided "as is" and there are no guarantees attached to them. If you want to use them, please do it at your own risk. In that case, we deeply recommend to you to look for professional legal advice.

## The Candidate Contract

It's a contract between an agent and the customer (candidate), where candidate set a mandate. If agent opens a hiring process according to it and candidate is finally hired, the agent will receive a fee, a % of candidate's gross annual salary (just for the first year), paid by candidate. 

In this contract, you can:

* Define both candidate and agent info
* Set the candidate mandate
* Set the agent fee

We have also clauses to manage edge cases as counteroffers, promotions or hiring processes not managed directly by the agent. Obviously, based on our very own 'candidate-centric' model.


## The Company Contract

Sometimes, companies approach us looking for talent. In this case, we work as both talent agents and head hunters. This is a contract between an agent and the customer (company), where company set a need (a job position with specific requirements). If agent opens a hiring process according to it and one candidate is finally hired, the agent will receive a fee, a % of candidate's gross annual salary (just for the first year), payed by company. 

In this contract, you can:

* Define both company and agent info
* Set the company needs
* Set the agent fee

We have also clauses to manage the whole hiring process. Obviously, based on our very own 'candidate-centric' model.
